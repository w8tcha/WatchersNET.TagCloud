*   WatchersNET.TagCloud - This Module displays the most frequently used words (Tags) of your Portal as a 
*   standard Web 2.0 Tag Cloud, or You can define your own Tags list.  The Tags are links which linked to the Portal Search to 
*   show all Pages with that Tag.
*
*   The Tag Cloud will be rendered as 3D Cloud, and as alternative for Non Flash 
*   Users as a list of hyperlinks in varying styles depending on a weight. 
*   This is similar to tag clouds in del.icio.us or Flickr.
